# Python-small-projects

In this repository you will find small and helpful scripts created with Python and tested by myself.This project created for education purpose only because i want to undrestand Python better and use it in my Pentesting demos.I believe that if you can learn how to create your tools against Security and find bugs only then you will understand the attacker and you will secure systems against them.
